# Postgres 12 Docker Image

This is required for the database, you may run Postgres the way you like, but for minimal set-up with PostgreSQL, I
provide this folder.

## Set-Up

### Simple Set-Up

```bash
# Pull the Docker image, you do this only once:
$ docker pull postgres

# Run the Docker image:
$ docker run postgres
```

### Advanced Set-Up

Please read [README_ADVANCED](./README_ADVANCED.md) for more details.
